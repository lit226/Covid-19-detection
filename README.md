Covid 19 detection detects patient suffering from coronavirus using their x-ray images.

## Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is the reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem. It's currently very popular in deep learning because it can train deep neural networks with comparatively little data.

## Model Used
### Efficientnet
EfficientNet is a convolutional neural network architecture and scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a compound coefficient.

### Architecture
